                            <h4>Burn Notice Season 1</h4>
                            <p>The first series of this sleek spy series mixes plenty of action with sex appeal and a dose of wry humor. While on a covert mission in Nigeria, spy Michael Westen (Jeffrey Donovan) discovers he's been burned, which equates to being fired in the world of espionage. After escaping the immediate danger of his assignment, he wakes up in Miami with no memory of how he got there and discovers his accounts have been frozen and his contacts cut off. Forced to fend for himself, Michael recruits the help of the only friends he has: Sam Axe (Bruce Campbell), a former intelligence contact whom the FBI has tapped to gain intel on Michael; Fiona Glenanne (Gabrielle Anwar), a spunky ex-IRA operative looking for closure after being dumped by Michael several years earlier; and Michael's meddling mother Madeline (Sharon Gless), who's thrilled to have her son back in her life. Despite the often uneasy state of these alliances, Sam, Fiona and Madeline each bring their own skills to the table to help Michael find out who burned him and why. In order to fund his investigation---not to mention more mundane expenses like rent---Michael picks up a side job as a private investigator helping Miami citizens obtain justice. Each episode chronicles a different case, opening the way for notable guest stars like Lucy Lawless ("Xena: Warrior Princess") and Richard Schiff ("West Wing"). But Michael's main goal throughout the season is following the convoluted trail of betrayals and double-dealings that led to his burn notice.</p>

                            <p>In the second series, Michael Westen (Jeffrey Donovan) is still looking for answers about his burn notice. He finds a lead in the mysterious Carla (guest star Tricia Helfer), who works for the organization that lead to his dismissal and who recruits Michael to perform tasks for her. But while he plays Carla's game, he also keeps up his day job helping out Miami locals plagued by an assortment of shady characters, including con artists, smugglers and thieves. By his side through it all, as always, are his faithful pal Sam (Bruce Campbell), his ex Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar) and his mom, Madeline (Sharon Gless).</p>

His exposure catches the eye of a Miami detective (Moon Bloodgood), who puts him under surveillance. While dealing with that threat, he also meets spy broker Tom Strickler (Ben Shenkman), who makes a lucrative offer in exchange for help with a dangerous mission. Chris Vance and Garret Dillahunt also guest star as two shady characters whom Michael must tangle with on his mission to make his way back to the CIA. Bruce Campbell, Gabrielle Anwar and Sharon Gless also star.</p>

                            <p>In series 5, Michael (Jeffrey Donovan) finally makes his way back to the CIA, but his life turns out to be no less complicated than when he was burned. After tracking down the people who worked for the organization that burned him, Michael finds himself framed for murder and under investigation by the CIA's Dani Pearce (Lauren Stamile). His troubles only worsen when a new big bad arrives on the scene: Anson Fullerton (Jere Burns), who uses Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar) as leverage to make Michael do his bidding.

                            <h4>Burn Notice Season 6</h4>
                            <p>The sixth series of USA's sturdy spy drama picks up with Michael (Jeffrey Donovan) and his crew—faithful allies Sam (Bruce Campbell) and Jesse (Coby Bell), and CIA agent Pearce (guest star Lauren Stamile)—on the trail of the scheming Anson (guest star Jere Burns). Fiona (Gabrielle Anwar), meanwhile, is forced to sit out on the action as she adjusts to her new digs in prison. While she is quick to prove to the other inmates that she can hold her own, she must also get to the bottom of an assassination attempt ordered from someone on the outside. Tom Card (guest star John C. McGinley) offers Fiona a possible way out of jail as a CIA asset, but she's not going anywhere until Michael takes down Anson. The motivation of Fiona's freedom adds fuel to Michael's pursuit, but the mission does not come without a steep and unexpected personal toll for Michael. Sharon Gless also stars.</p>

                            <p>In the seventh and final series, Michael (Jeffrey Donovan) is once again working with the CIA under new handler Andrew Strong (Jack Coleman). But this time he must do his job without the assistance of his trusty team...at least for a little while. His mission is to get close to shady defence-contract facility leader Burke (Adrian Pasdar), who in turn directs Michael to track down Sonya (Alona Tal), a woman being held by Russian spies. But finding Sonya proves to be the easy part; Michael must convince her to clue him into the dealings of her organization and set up a meeting with her boss, the mysterious James (John Pyper-Ferguson). Gabrielle Anwar, Bruce Campbell, Coby Bell and Sharon Gless also star.</p>
