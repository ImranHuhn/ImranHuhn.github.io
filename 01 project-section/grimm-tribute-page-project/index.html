                <h4>Nick Burkhardt</h4>
                <p>From FANDOM: <br>Nicholas "Nick" Burkhardt (born June 18, 1982) is a Grimm and detective for the Portland Police Department. Growing up, he was not exposed to any information regarding his Grimm heritage or the Wesen that surrounded him. He learned about these largely from his own experiences since 2011, which made him unique among Grimms and generally promoting the development of more socially acceptable interaction with all individuals. In 2014, he temporarily lost his Grimm powers ("Blond Ambition") before he regained them  ("Highway of Tears"). He later discovered that Adalind was pregnant with his son ("Iron Hans") from when he slept with her while she was disguised as Juliette. Adalind gave birth to their son, Kelly Schade-Burkhardt, in 2015, ("The Grimm Identity") and the three of them eventually moved to a safer residence at a loft. ("Lost Boys") Ironically, Nick was nearly shot and killed in the loft months later at the hands of Black Claw, but he was saved by the healing powers of a mysterious stick that he and Monroe recovered in the Black Forest of Germany after Nick had come to possess five of the seven keys. ("Map of the Seven Knights") ("Into the Schwarzwald") ("The Beginning of the End")<br></p>
                <p><br>From WIKIPEDIA: <br>Nicholas Burkhardt (played by David Giuntoli) is the show's protagonist and titular Grimm. Nick is a homicide detective who discovers he is descended from a line of Grimms: hunters who fight supernatural forces. Even before his abilities manifested, Nick had an exceptional ability to make quick and accurate deductions about the motivations and pasts of individuals. This power has now expressed itself as his ability to perceive the supernatural that nobody else can see. Nick had wanted to propose to his girlfriend, Juliette, for some time, but he felt that he would have to tell her about his life as a Grimm beforehand.

                Throughout the first season, Nick struggles to maintain balance with his normal life and his life as a grimm. The two tend to cross when he works cases that involve wesen, which are the creatures of the grimm world. As Nick dives deeper into his grimm heritage, he begins to train with Monroe to learn about the wesen in Portland and to use the weapons that his aunt Marie left behind. As of episode 19, Nick had successfully killed three reapers, creatures that are sent out to kill grimms (hence the grimm reaper title). He kills the first in defense of Marie, and the other two are killed in self-defense after being sent Nick's lead suspect in a case. The latter two have their heads sent back home with a note saying to send the best next time. In the season finale, Nick's worries about a scratch Juliette received from Adalind's cat force him to reveal his grimm heritage to her, which makes Juliette believe he has gone crazy. When bringing her to the trailer is not enough to convince her, they go to Monroe's house so that Nick can show her his blutbad form, though before Monroe can show her, Juliette collapses. Rosalee discovers that Juliette is going through memory loss, but when Juliette wakes up it is revealed that the only thing she has forgotten is Nick.
                
                Nick, after believing for eighteen years that both of his parents died in a car crash, discovers that his mother is alive and well in the first episode of season two. At this time, but he still does not know her true motives or agenda. At the end of season three, Nick's grimm powers are removed by Adalind as a result of sleeping with her – she had disguised herself as Juliette. He regains his powers in "Highway Of Tears".
                
                Nick later learns that Adalind is pregnant with his child, which is revealed to be a boy when Adalind gives birth. She names the boy "Kelly" after Nick's mother. At the beginning of Season 5, Nick and the group become involved in a secret war between Hadrian's Wall (HW) – a secret government organization that Trubel and Meisner are a part of – and Black Claw, a worldwide wesen revolutionary group. Nick sells his home and buys a secret, fortified loft to better protect Adalind and Kelly. As Nick and Adalind raise Kelly together, they grow closer and Nick shows himself to be a devoted father. At the end of "Wesen Nacht", Nick is shocked to learn that Juliette has survived, as is now working for HW under the new persona of Eve. In "Map of the Seven Knights", Nick comes into contact with Monroe's uncle, who is killed by Black Claw. After avenging his murder, Nick acquires twenty new grimm books, a new cache of weapons and three more map keys. With these, he figures out the location of the Templar's hidden treasure. In "Key Move" and "Into the Schwarzwald", Nick and Monroe travel to Germany to find this treasure. The group discovers that the treasure is a stick of wood with healing properties. Nick learns that Renard is working with Black Claw to become Mayor and that Renard may use Diana to get to Adalind. By this time, Rosalee reveals that Adalind's hexenbiest powers have returned while he was in Germany, but keeps it a secret until Adalind herself reveals it. Adalind is forced by Renard, Bonaparte and unknowingly Diana, to take Kelly and leave Nick. Nick becomes distraught over losing his son and girlfriend and fights hard to get them back, which culminates in a vicious fight between him and Renard at the police station. Nick is arrested for assault but is later set free by Eve, Trubel and Wu. Diana warns Nick that Black Claw is coming for them. He subsequently leads the group into an underground tunnel underneath his loft while he stays behind to deal with the attackers. Despite overwhelming numbers and the stick's healing powers, Nick kills all of the assailants before being confronted with Renard and Bonaparte. Before Bonaparte can kill Nick, he is killed by Diana, who learned Bonaparte had tortured Adalind to give up their location.
                
                It is assumed that Nick and Adalind got married sometime after the series finale.</p>

                <h4>Juliette Silverton/Eve</h4>
                <p>From FANDOM: <br>Doctor Juliette Silverton, now known as Eve, was a domestic animal veterinarian, a Hexenbiest and the ex-girlfriend of Nick Burkhardt. She studied at Oregon State University, located about 90 minutes from her and Nick's former home in Portland, Oregon. ("Big Feet") She worked at the Roseway Veterinary Hospital beginning in 2006. ("Bad Moon Rising")

                Like with Hank, her direct interactions with Nick led to her receiving her fair share of the supernatural world, including getting put into a coma by one of Adalind's Zaubertranks. ("Woman in Black") After waking up, Juliette went on to find answers of her own and, with Monroe's reluctant help, eventually became a Kehrseite-Schlich-Kennen. However, she later became a Hexenbiest as a side effect of a Verfluchte Zwillingsschwester potion.
                
                Eve, formerly known as Juliette Silverton, is a Hexenbiest who was broken down by Hadrian's Wall to get her to control her immense powers, so they could use her as a weapon in the war against Black Claw. She first appeared in "Wesen Nacht".<br></p>  
                <p><br>From WIKIPEDIA: <br>Juliette Silverton (seasons 1 to 4), later Eve (seasons 5 & 6), (played by Bitsie Tulloch) is Nick's girlfriend. She works as a veterinarian, and spent much of her childhood with her grandmother in Spain, which made her fluent in Castilian Spanish (although her accent is similar to that found in Latin America). Although Marie suggested that Nick should leave Juliette for her safety, he decided to stay with her. He postponed his original plans to propose to her while he explored his new life as a Grimm. However, in "The Thing with Feathers", he proposes, only for her to turn him down because she felt he was hiding something. In "Woman in Black", Juliette suffers a scratch while treating Adalind Schade's cat. When Nick reacts with horror, Juliette demands he tell her what's going on. Nick tries to explain by bringing her to the trailer and then to Monroe, but Juliette falls unconscious and is taken to the hospital.

                She eventually awakens from her coma with help from Rosalee, and a potion prepared for and delivered by Renard. Due to a spell, all her memories of Nick have been erased – though she can remember everything else about her life. She begins to develop an unusual attraction to Captain Renard due to his role in awakening her. She fights this attraction due to her complicated relationship with Nick. After drinking a potion to break the compulsive attraction, she starts hallucinating sounds and images, such as envisioning that the floor of her house had collapsed. She thinks that she is going crazy, but is really regaining her memories of Nick. In "One Angry Fuchsbau" she begins seeing many clear visions of Nick, which overwhelms her. Seeking help, she contacts the Mexican woman she met in "La Llorona" who tells her to concentrate on a single memory at a time to completely remember them. In "Kiss of the Muse", she returns to the trailer by herself and remembers what Nick told her the first night she went there. In "The Waking Dead", Juliette convinces Monroe to tell her the truth of grimms and the wesen world, which he, along with Rosalee and Bud, do by wogeing in front of her. From this point on, she starts to become increasingly interested in Nick's grimm activities and joins him and his allies in fighting zombies. She later helps Nick to find a cure for a rare disease that gives humans a wesen-like appearance.
                
                She becomes a hexenbiest after using a spell to sleep with Nick to give him back his grimm powers, which leads to drastic changes in her personality. She becomes far colder and less empathetic, starting fights with everyone she comes across with, and she develops an enjoyment from the powers she now possesses. She begins working for the royals after learning Adalind had become pregnant with Nick's child. She burns Nick's trailer and lures his mother into a trap so the royals could take Diana. She was later killed by Trubel in the Season 4 finale, "Cry Havoc", after trying to kill Nick.
                
                However, Hadrian's Wall saved her life, broke her down to nothing and then rebuilt her as an emotionally distant assassin called Eve. Having conquered her rage and properly practiced her powers, Eve becomes incredibly powerful, able to kill twenty Black Claw members by herself.[1] She goes to any extreme to complete her missions, such as assassinate a known Black Claw organizer in a crowded restaurant, or breathing in a potion to transform herself into Renard to learn of their leaders. However, Eve still has remnants of Juliette's personality. She is drawn to Nick due to their past and threatens Adalind not to hurt him. In "The Beginning of the End", Eve is gravely injured by the Black Claw leader, Bonaparte, who is a powerful zauberbiest in his own right. When Nick saved her with the Templar treasure (a wooden stick with healing properties), she suffered a seizure. Upon awakening, she is very emotional and confused, leading Nick to wonder if Juliette had returned.</p>

                <h4>Hank Griffin</h4>
                <p>From FANDOM: <br>Hank Griffin is a homicide detective with the Portland, Oregon police force. He is Nick Burkhardt's partner and close friend. Like Nick, Hank is laid back and fair. He is a skilled detective, and, although initially unaware that Nick had a secret, he knew that Nick's ability to "see something" in people was uncanny, bordering on impossibly accurate. Nearly driven to the brink of insanity, he finally learned Nick's status as a Grimm and about Wesen, and, in the process, got further involved into the supernatural world. ("Bad Moon Rising") ("Quill") Learning about Wesen proved especially valuable to Nick, as Hank not only helped him find information on various Wesen in the Grimm Diaries, more significantly, he helped save his life on more than one occasion. ("Over My Dead Body") ("Cold Blooded") ("Hibernaculum") After solving many Wesen-related cases with Nick, and later Wu, Hank came to suspect that most crimes they investigated involve some type of Wesen. Hank was married three times, with the second marriage being to an anthropologist. ("Bears Will Be Bears") Hank has a weak stomach for gory human carcasses and is murophobic.<br></p>
                <p><br>From WIKIPEDIA: <br>Hank Griffin (played by Russell Hornsby) is Nick's detective partner and best friend who, like Juliette, was not aware that Nick is a grimm until season 2. He is sarcastic at times and had gone through at least four marriages by the time the series begins. Throughout the first season, Hank starts to notice the strange occurrences in Portland and in some of the cases he works on with Nick. Adalind, in an attempt to get closer to Nick, gave Hank a "love sick" potion that caused him to develop obsessive behavior towards her. In "Big Feet", Hank accidentally runs into a transformed Monroe, who was leading search dogs away from a friend of his. This, combined with seeing a dead suspect change back into human form, causes Hank to have nightmares and paranoia when he is home. In "Bad Moon Rising", Hank starts to doubt whether he can continue police work given his state of mind.

                When searching for the missing daughter of an old friend from high school, Hank learns Nick is a grimm. Hank tells Nick that he is comfortable knowing the truth, reflecting that, while he may be crazy, at least there is someone else who is crazy as well. After this, Hank becomes increasingly invested in the wesen world, even participating in Nick's hunts to stop enemy wesen. In season 3, when Wu first encounters the wesen world, Hank wants to reveal everything so that Wu does not face the same issues he did. In "Wesenrein", Hank tells Wu that he related to him, having been in the same position himself. In Season 5, Hank becomes involved with Hadrian's Wall, a secret government organization fighting against a worldwide wesen revolutionary group called Black Claw. He soon starts a relationship with his former physical therapist, Zuri (also a wesen), whom he later discovers to be working with Black Claw.</p>

                </div>
                <h4>Drew Wu</h4>
                <p>From FANDOM: <br>Drew Wu is a police sergeant at the same precinct as Nick Burkhardt and Hank Griffin. He serves as an assistant to Captain Renard and he often arrives at the scene of a crime before Nick and Hank. After being scratched by a Lycanthrope, ("Lycanthropia") he started changing into a primal version of himself when his emotions were high. Initially, he blacked out and didn't remember anything that he did in this state, but he later was able to gain control over his newfound form. ("Good to the Bone") ("The Taming of the Wu")<br></p>  
                <p><br>From WIKIPEDIA: <br>Drew Wu (played by Reggie Lee) is a police sergeant who works with Nick and Hank. He tends to do the "grunt work" for them, collecting facts and information. He is often sarcastic and has a dry sense of humor.

                In "Island of Dreams", when Adalind gives Hank some Zaubertrank (love potion) cookies as part of her revenge plot against Nick, Wu eats one. Since the Zaubertrank was not created for him, it causes adverse effects. Nick advises him to visit the spice shop, but as he arrives he passes out his face breaks out in lesions. Fortunately, Rosalee has seen this effect before and manages to quickly create a potion to cure him. The cure causes Wu to have brief hallucinations of everyone's faces melting, but is ultimately a success. Though cured of the welts and sickness, Wu is left with a lasting effect of the Zaubertrank – he tries to ingest things that were inedible, such as paper clips and coins. Two episodes later, in "Love Sick" Rosalee creates another potion which clears the last of the Zaubertrank effects. No after effects are shown and he has no memory of what he had been doing.
                
                In "Mommy Dearest" he becomes traumatized by a wesen called the Aswang – a creature whose inclusion was inspired by Filipino folklore. As a child, his grandmother told him stories of the Aswang which scared him. He sees one when trying to protect his childhood friend, Dana, which gives him flashbacks to his grandmother's storytelling. The trauma caused by this incident makes Wu check himself into a psychiatric hospital. Later, Juliette visits him and confides in Wu, sharing the experience of regaining her memories. She tells him she thought she was going crazy and seeing ghosts. When Wu asks how she got over thinking it was real, she tells him that it didn't matter whether it was real, what mattered was losing her fear of it. This has a big impact on Wu and he later feels well enough to check out of the hospital.
                
                However, in "Chupacabra" he is told by Nick that wesen are real, which puts him on edge, and eventually leaves him in a state of shock. After going to a bar in "Wesenrein" and causing a disturbance, Nick and Hank take him to the trailer, Wu learns that Nick is a grimm. After saving Monroe's life, Wu becomes increasingly fascinated with the wesen world and accurately deduces whenever a case has wesen-like qualities.
                
                In season 5, after being scratched by a Lycanthrope (a Blutbad with a genetic disease), he has night sweats, joint pains, and strange dreams. This culminates when, in a heightened emotional state, he transforms into a Neanderthal-like version of himself with enhanced strength and wesen-like ferocity. At first, he blacks out and cannot recall what happened. Upon learning of his condition, Wu demonstrates greater control over his primal form, becoming self-aware and is able to distinguish friend from foe.</p>

                </div>
                <h4>Eddie Monroe</h4>
                <p>From FANDOM: <br>Monroe is a Wieder Blutbad who used to live a fairly solitary, reformed life among humans, until he met Detective Nick Burkhardt during a case.

                The pair form an unlikely friendship as result of Nick oftentimes calling upon Monroe for help. Most times Monroe is consulted for his knowledge pertaining to creatures of the Wesen world, when Nick can't find the answer. In addition, Nick has come to rely on Monroe's support in various capacities: Monroe has helped from tracking suspects to protection to clandestine investigative methods. He met his wife Rosalee whilst helping Nick on a case. Monroe went on to have triplets with Rosalee.<br></p>
                <p><br>From WIKIPEDIA: <br>Monroe (played by Silas Weir Mitchell) is a creature of the grimm world (a wieder blutbad) who aids Nick with his cases. He becomes a good friend of Nick's, even though he has some issues with grimms since a grimm killed his grandfather. Monroe does not know that there are any grimms left until he meets Nick. In the first season, Monroe is attacked by the reapers because he helps Nick with his cases. After the attack, Nick tells Monroe that he will not ask for any more assistance. Monroe, despite his occasional dissatisfaction with the demands Nick places on him, decides to continue helping Nick, saying that he enjoys disrupting the "status quo". Monroe is knowledgeable about the supernatural creatures that Nick goes up against. Whenever the second-hand knowledge that Nick acquires from his ancestors' books is inadequate, Monroe serves as Nick's direct source of insight and information. He also helps make contact with creatures that would avoid Nick due to his status as a grimm, and assists Nick when cases require him to rely on someone who knows about the threats he faces.

                In "Big Feet", when Monroe's friend is injured and suffering from the side effects of an experimental drug, he takes his friend's jacket and makes the search dogs chase him. While being chased in the forest, he is surrounded by the search dogs and transforms into his blutbad form to scare them off, but runs into Hank when he heads back to his house. Because he allowed his changed form to be seen by normal beings, Hank was able to see it before he runs off. In "Woman in Black", Nick brings Juliette over to Monroe's place so that he can change in front of her, to prove his grimm heritage. However, before Monroe could allow himself to be seen by her, Juliette collapses from the scratch made by Adalind's cat.
                
                Monroe explores a relationship with Rosalee, although they are taking their time due to their pre-existing friendship. While running the spice shop, Monroe comes into contact with Sean Renard, who complains of obsessive behavior. Monroe says he can make the compulsions go away, but he needs both Sean and the person he is obsessed with together. In "To Protect and Serve Man", he discovers that the obsession Sean has been fighting against is for Juliette, which puts him in a very difficult and awkward situation. He and Rosalee help Juliette and Captain Renard to break the bond between them. In season 3 "A Dish Best Served Cold", Monroe asks Rosalee to move in with him which she does in the next episode, "One Night Stand". Monroe and Rosalee get married in "Blond Ambition".
                
                In season 4, an old medieval wesen group, whose goal is to keep wesen pure (no hybridization or inter-wesen marriages), capture Monroe and attempt to kill him for his "crimes". He is later freed with the help of Nick and Rosalee, among others. In season 5, Monroe is drawn into the war between Hadrian's wall and Black Claw. He is concerned for Rosalee when her ex-boyfriend, Tony, begins reaching out to her. The battle becomes personal for him when his uncle, who had recently acquired a large number of grimm books for Nick, is murdered by Black Claw. Upon learning the location of the Templar's treasure, Monroe and Nick travel to Germany to find it, but Monroe is bitten and his wound becomes infected by the time they get back. The treasure is a piece of wood that somehow heals Monroe's wound. In the last two episodes of season 5, Monroe comes face-to-face with Tony when it is discovered that Tony is a member of Black Claw. Upon escaping Black Claws clutches, Rosalee reveals she is pregnant with his child, which delights him.
                
                His last name has not been stated so far. In a phone call, his parents called him Monroe, seeming to indicate that it is his first name. However, the season 1 boxset features stated Monroe's name as 'Eddie Monroe', though actor Silas Weir Mitchell has since dismissed this as Monroe's full name.[2]</p>

                <h4>Rosalee Calvert</h4>
                <p>From FANDOM: <br>Rosalee Calvert is a Fuchsbau, apothecary, and Monroe's wife. She first appeared in "Island of Dreams", in which her brother, Freddy, was killed and she saved Monroe's life by hitting his attacker in the head with a brick. She went on to have triplets with Monroe.<br></p>  
                <p><br>From WIKIPEDIA: <br>Rosalee Calvert (recurring season 1; regular seasons 2 to 6), (played by Bree Turner) is a fox-like creature, called a Fuchsbau, and the sister of Freddie, the proprietor of the herb shop used as a front for the Geier organ trafficking business seen in "Organ Grinder". After Freddie's death in "Island of Dreams", Rosalee comes to Portland to sort out her brother's affairs and decides to stick around. Prior to living in Portland she tried to follow her parents' profession as an apothecary, but in spite of her aptitude for it, did not like the job. She became hooked on a highly addictive wesen-oriented drug street-named 'J' and left Portland to get clean. After deciding to keep her brother's shop running, Rosalee assists Nick and Monroe in their efforts by providing additional information and remedies to supernatural problems.

                Rosalee shares a powerful connection with Monroe. In "Quill", they go on their first date and share their first kiss, after which Rosalee uncharacteristically attempts to seduce Monroe. This seduction attempt turns out to be the manifestation of a common symptom from the wesen virus Rosalee had been exposed to during their date. After being cured, Rosalee and Monroe agree that the attraction between them was real, but decide to take it slow before becoming intimate with each other. In season 3, "A Dish Best Served Cold", Monroe asks Rosalee to move in with him and she does so in the next episode, "One Night Stand". In "The Wild Hunt", Monroe proposes to her and she accepts, but this is met with frosty reception from his parents who are very traditional about inter-species marriages. Monroe and his parents have since mended their relationship.
                
                Rosalee marries Monroe at the end of season 3, but throughout half of season 4, they are stalked and ridiculed by a wesen purity group called Wesenrein. After learning of Juliette's new status as a Hexenbiest, Rosalee tries to reach out to her. She is unsuccessful, but does not give up trying to save her until Juliette almost killed Monroe. In season 5, she and the group get involved in a war between Hadrian's Wall and Black Claw. During this time, she becomes friends with Adalind after Kelly's birth. Tony, a former boyfriend, starts reaching out to her, and appears in "Into the Schwarzwald". He asks Rosalee for money and assaults her when she refuses. When Adalind defends herself and Rosalee from Tony, Rosalee sees that her powers have returned, and encourages her to tell Nick. Upon learning that she did not, Rosalee tells Nick about Adalind's powers returning, but encourages him to let Adalind tell him in her own time.
                
                In the season 5 finale, Rosalee reveals to Monroe that she is pregnant with their first child. In season 6, she and monroe find out she is having triplets.</p>

                <h4>Sean Renard</h4>
                <p>From FANDOM: <br>Sean Renard (born as Prince Sean on October 21, 1970) ("Stories We Tell Our Young") is the Captain of the South Precinct, who formerly ("Breakfast in Bed") was a member of Black Claw.<br></p>
                <p><br>From WIKIPEDIA: <br>Sean Renard (played by Sasha Roiz) is a politically-adept police captain who is Nick's superior officer. Unknown to Nick during the first season, Renard is a human–creature hybrid with magical abilities called a Zauberbiest (the male form of Hexenbiest). In episode 12, he is addressed as Your Highness, implying that he belongs to royalty in the creature community, and he is later revealed to be a prince connected to royal blood. He references my canton, which implies that he has a leadership role. This is emphasised when he appears to protect wesen engaging in illicit acts. In "The Kiss", he consumed a potion to make him pure of heart so that he could wake Juliette, wanting to keep her active so that he could ensure Nick's continued presence in his city. In "The Other Side", his brother, Eric, mentioned to Adalind that Sean's mother was a Hexenbiest and that he only had royal blood on one side of his family – this is one reason why Catherine Schade referred to him as a bastard. As a result of his illegitimate status, he and his mother were forced to flee from Europe. He now considers himself independent of the royal families and is a known ally of the resistance against them. He developed an attraction to Juliette due to his role in awakening her from the coma, but attempts to resist it. He, Nick and Juliette all drink a potion mixed by Rosalee that breaks the compulsion.

                Since the revelation of his heritage, Sean has been more open with Nick about grimm-related cases. He admits that he is distant from his family and prefers for Nick over them. He is the father of Adalind's daughter Diana, who has unique powers.
                
                During season 4, he experiences moments of unexplained bleeding after his mother saves his life using an ancient spell. It is revealed at the conclusion of the season that the bleeding is a result of him being "possessed" by the spirit of Jack the Ripper – who was a killer of wesen in life – until the rest of the team are able to "exorcise" Jack from his body.
                
                In season 5, he is subtly manipulated by the pro-wesen group, Black Claw, to take on the role of running for mayor, eventually coming to favour their campaign for power. However, after he attempts to get Nick and his allies accused of murder, Nick is able to get Renard to step down as mayor. Nick does this by using a complex spell to turn himself into Renard and publicly abdicate while claiming that the accusations against Nick were part of a sting operation.</p>

                <h4>Adalind Schade</h4>
                <p>From FANDOM: <br>Adalind Schade (born April 14, 1985) ("Map of the Seven Knights") is a Hexenbiest who first appeared in "Pilot". Nick Burkhardt first noticed her outside a jewelry store where she momentarily woged into her Hexenbiest form. She resigned from her job as a lawyer at Berman, Rautbort Law before leaving Portland, ("Woman in Black") and temporarily returned to the law firm nearly four years later.<br></p>  
                <p><br>From WIKIPEDIA: <br>Adalind Schade (recurring seasons 1 & 2 (part); regular seasons 2 (part) to 6), (played by Claire Coffee) is a witch-like creature called a Hexenbiest who seemed to be working for Renard during season 1. In "Love Sick", after ingesting Nick's blood, she becomes a completely normal human. Renard tells her that she is no longer useful to him since she is no longer a wesen. Although not a true Hexenbiest anymore, Adalind retains her knowledge and skill with potions and Nick now describes her as a witch. In "Woman in Black", she gets Juliette scratched by a poisoned (or magicked) cat. Monroe and Rosalee retrieve the cat, but find that Adalind has vanished.

                Sometime later, Adalind resurfaces in Vienna to rendezvous with Eric Renard. She becomes pregnant with the child of Eric or Sean Renard – which one is unspecified – then attempts to bargain with the royal families. She asks her Hexenbiest powers to be given back in return for the child, threatening to terminate the pregnancy if they do not do so.
                
                In "Mommy Dearest", she becomes a Hexenbiest again after giving birth to a daughter whom she names Diana. Later, after beginning her search for her missing child, she discovers that she is pregnant with Nick's son. She lies to the royals about the child, claiming it is Viktor's, but Prince Kenneth uncovers the truth after informing her that Viktor is sterile. When he decides to lure Juliette into working for him to find Diana, Adalind tells Nick the truth about his child. Later, her powers are suppressed when she tests a potion meant for Juliette. After complications from giving birth to her son by C-section, she names him "Kelly" after Nick's late mother, who died protecting her daughter Diana.
                
                She becomes more compassionate after the birth of her son, even telling Rosalee that she does not want to be a Hexenbiest anymore; she does not want there to be friction between her and Nick that could affect Kelly. While she and Nick are living together to raise Kelly, they let go of past animosities and develop romantic feelings for one another. In episode 100, Adalind's Hexenbiest powers return when she defends herself against Rosalee's ex-boyfriend, breaking all of his fingers in the process. She fears that Nick would abandon her if he finds out her powers are back. During this time, she returns to her old job as a lawyer, but she is antagonized by Renard and Black Claw leader Bonaparte, who claim her daughter is with them. Soon, Adalind tells Nick the truth about her powers to and her fears that Renard and Black Claw will use Diana to get to her. Given a dangerous ultimatum by Diana disguised as Renard, Adalind is forced to leave with Kelly. Despite Renard's attempts to win her back and Bonaparte threatening her, Adalind remains loyal to Nick, refusing to reveal his location to them. When Bonaparte tortures the location out of her, Adalind has Diana send Nick a message about the danger heading his way. Diana kills Bonaparte in revenge for the torture he put Adalind through.
                
                It is assumed that Nick and Adalind got married sometime after the series finale.</p>

                <h4>Theresa "Trubel" Rubel</h4>
                <p>From FANDOM: <br>Theresa "Trubel" Rubel (born April 29, 1993) is a Grimm and member of Hadrian's Wall who first appeared in "Nobody Knows the Trubel I've Seen". Before meeting Nick, she had never benefited from a guide to explain the implications of her Grimm status to her. She has battle scars on her back and side.<br></p>
                <p><br>From WIKIPEDIA: <br>Theresa Rubel (played by Jacqueline Toboni) often known as Trubel (pronounced "trouble"), is a vagrant runaway and a grimm, although she has no prior knowledge of what "grimm" means. She has had to defend herself from wesen who recognize her as a grimm, but when she describes her experiences, she is called mad or lying. As a result, she spends time in several mental institutions. Monroe identifies her as a grimm during their initial (and almost deadly) encounter. At the end of season 3, she is staying at Nick's home and learning about the world of grimms and wesen.

                At the start of season 4, she acts as the local grimm, keeping the bads of the wesen community in check until Nick gets his powers back. After helping Nick find a way to get back being a grimm, she goes on her own with Josh Porter, to teach him how to fight and survive without grimm powers. She also aims to become her own grimm by searching for herself. She later returns to help after receiving a phone call from Monroe and Rosalee's. She kills Juliette with a crossbow in the season 4 finale "Cry Havoc" because Juliette was trying to kill Nick. In season 5, she works for Hadrian's Wall along with Eve and Meisner, but was still considered to be primarily an ally to Nick's team rather than a member of Hadrian's Wall, to the extent that Nick told her about the mystery healing stick while keeping it secret from the organization as a whole.</p>

                <h4>Kelly Kessler Burkhardt</h4>
                <p>From FANDOM: <br>Kelly Burkhardt (née Kessler) (1960-2015) was a Grimm, the sister of Marie Kessler, the widow of Reed Burkhardt, and the mother of Nick Burkhardt. She first appeared in "Woman in Black".<br></p>  
                <p><br>From WIKIPEDIA: <br>Kelly Kessler Burkhardt (played by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) is Nick Burkhardt's mother, and is also a grimm. Her first appearance is in the last episode of season 1 (episode 22). For 18 years, Nick believed that both of his parents had died in a car crash. After learning that he was a grimm Nick discovers that his parents had actually been murdered; but in reality, Kelly has been alive the whole time. When Nick reunites with his mother in episode 23 (season 2, episode 1), she tells Nick that his father was killed in the car crash but that the woman with him was mistaken for Kelly by both the authorities and the killer. Kelly explains to Nick that she had pretended to be dead for 18 years because it was the best way to protect Nick from his father's murderer. Kelly assists Nick with his investigation on the attacks by the "mauvais dentes". Nick takes his mother to Marie's trailer, which Kelly and Marie had bought together after their father became ill. Later, in episode 24 (season 2, episode 2), Kelly talks with Catherine Schade in an attempt to find a cure for Juliette. Catherine tells Kelly that a prince is in Portland, but Kelly accidentally kills Catherine before being able to find out the prince's identity. At the end of the episode, Nick, thinking that she was going to zakynthos to destroy the "coins of zakynthos", takes Kelly to the train station. After Nick drives away from the station, Kelly is seen stealing a car instead of entering the station.

                In season 3, she returns to Portland with Adalind and newly-born Diana. She is last seen leaving in a truck with Adalind's baby, in an attempt to keep her safe.
                
                In the season 4 episode "Headache" Nick returns home to find Kelly's severed head in a box as a result of an ambush by the royals. He deduces that Juliette, working for the royals, lured Kelly into a trap so they could take Diana. Kelly never finds out that Adalind is pregnant with her grandson Kelly, who is named after her. Until the finale episode in season 6, where she tells Nick to look after her grandson, and that she likes the name they gave him.</p>

He is initially frightened of Nick, believing him to be as violent as the mythical grimms. Because of this, Bud behaves subserviently towards Nick, offering to fix things and giving Nick gifts. It is only after Nick calls upon Bud for help in a murder case that Bud realizes Nick is a good person. The two become friends, although he is still somewhat jittery when he and Nick meet. Bud played an important role in stopping a wesen lawyer who used his pheromones to manipulate juries to favor his clients.</p>
