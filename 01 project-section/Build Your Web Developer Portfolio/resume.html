                            <h5>Burn Notice: Season 1</h5>
                            <p>Synopsis</p>
                            <p>The first series of this sleek spy series mixes plenty of action with sex appeal and a dose of wry humor. While on a covert mission in Nigeria, spy Michael Westen (Jeffrey Donovan) discovers he's been burned, which equates to being fired in the world of espionage. After escaping the immediate danger of his assignment, he wakes up in Miami with no memory of how he got there and discovers his accounts have been frozen and his contacts cut off. Forced to fend for himself, Michael recruits the help of the only friends he has: Sam Axe (Bruce Campbell), a former intelligence contact whom the FBI has tapped to gain intel on Michael; Fiona Glenanne (Gabrielle Anwar), a spunky ex-IRA operative looking for closure after being dumped by Michael several years earlier; and Michael's meddling mother Madeline (Sharon Gless), who's thrilled to have her son back in her life. Despite the often uneasy state of these alliances, Sam, Fiona and Madeline each bring their own skills to the table to help Michael find out who burned him and why. In order to fund his investigation---not to mention more mundane expenses like rent---Michael picks up a side job as a private investigator helping Miami citizens obtain justice. Each episode chronicles a different case, opening the way for notable guest stars like Lucy Lawless ("Xena: Warrior Princess") and Richard Schiff ("West Wing"). But Michael's main goal throughout the season is following the convoluted trail of betrayals and double-dealings that led to his burn notice.</p>

                            <p>The sixth series of USA's sturdy spy drama picks up with Michael (Jeffrey Donovan) and his crew—faithful allies Sam (Bruce Campbell) and Jesse (Coby Bell), and CIA agent Pearce (guest star Lauren Stamile)—on the trail of the scheming Anson (guest star Jere Burns).

Tom Card (guest star John C. McGinley) offers Fiona a possible way out of jail as a CIA asset, but she's not going anywhere until Michael takes down Anson. The motivation of Fiona's freedom adds fuel to Michael's pursuit, but the mission does not come without a steep and unexpected personal toll for Michael. Sharon Gless also stars.</p>
